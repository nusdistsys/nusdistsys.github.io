If a leader already exists, other servers inform the new one which server is the leader. At this point, the new server connects to the leader and makes sure that its own state is consistent with the state of the leader.
If an ensemble of servers, however, are all in the LOOKING state, they must communicate to elect a leader. They exchange messages to converge on a common choice for the leader. The server that wins this election enters the LEADING state, while the other servers in the ensemble enter the FOLLOWING state.</p><p>The leader election messages are called leader election notifications, or simply notifica‐ tions. The protocol is extremely simple. When a server enters the LOOKING state, it sends a batch of notification messages, one to each of the other servers in the ensemble. The message contains its current vote, which consists of the server’s identifier (sid) and the zxid (zxid) of the most recent transaction it executed. Thus, (1,5) is a vote sent by the server with a sid of 1 and a most recent zxid of 5.</p><p>Server changes vote if it receives a vote that has a higher zxid and a higher server number (in that order)</p><h2 id=zab-zookeeper-atomic-broadcast-protcol>ZAB (Zookeeper atomic broadcast protcol)</h2><p>ZAB does a two phase commit</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28092058/74420774-f159cd80-4e86-11ea-9db7-bc3d353d1a9f.png alt="two phase"></p><ol><li>The leader sends a PROPOSAL message, p, to all followers.</li><li>Upon receiving p, a follower responds to the leader with an ACK, informing the
